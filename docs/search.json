    "text": "My classic academic training is in mathematical and statistical modeling of ecological systems.\nMy work primarily focuses on natural resource management. I use difference/differential equation modeling, agent-based modeling, matrix projection models, and more. Here are some highlights of my work:\n\nManaging the sylvatic plague in black-tailed prairie dogs\nDe-extinction strategies for the passenger pigeon\nVaccination strategies for white-nose syndrome in little brown bats\nModeling sublethal stressors on bee colonies\nHunting strategies to suppress the winter tick epizootic in moose\nModeling pollen competition and interference in plants\n\nMy complete works can be found on my Google Scholar Profile\nI enjoy working with interdisciplinary teams, and with colleagues across the world. If you’re interested in working together, please reach out to me!\nI’ve worked with several student researchers, from REUs, programs internal to UWL, federal scholar programs, etc. If you are interested in undergraduate research, please reach out to me!"

The mission of the CDC is to\n“…deliver actionable, data-driven insights at no cost to non-profit organizations and public services in the Coulee Region of Southwestern Wisconsin and Southeastern Minnesota, empowering them to make informed decisions and amplify their impact.”\nEach semester the CDC collaborates with a local partner on a data analysis project. Our first partner is Habitat for Humanity of the Greater La Crosse Region! More details about our work is available on our CDC website (under construction).\nIf you know of a local partner that would like to work with the CDC, or you would like to cover the work of the CDC, please reach out to me!\nEach semester the CDC appoints up to three students as “Data Diplomats” that work on these projects. If you’re interested in becoming a Data Diplomat, please reach out to me!"
