title: "Coulee Data Center"

I founded the [Coulee Data Center (CDC)](https://coulee-data-center.github.io/) in 2025. The mission of the CDC is to

*"...deliver actionable, data-driven insights at no cost to non-profit organizations and public services in the Coulee Region of Southwestern Wisconsin and Southeastern Minnesota, empowering them to make informed decisions and amplify their impact."*

Each semester the CDC collaborates with a local partner on a data analysis project. Our first partner is Habitat for Humanity of the Greater La Crosse Region! More details about our work is available on our CDC website (under construction).

If you know of a local partner that would like to work with the CDC, or you would like to cover the work of the CDC, please [reach out to me](contact.qmd)!

Each semester the CDC appoints up to three students as "Data Diplomats" that work on these projects. If you're interested in becoming a Data Diplomat, please [reach out to me](contact.qmd)!
